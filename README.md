# Netflix-Clustering-Association-Rules-and-Recommneder-Systems
This project implements a recommendation system using K-Means clustering to recommend a user movies and tv-shows based on user's likings. 

Verified Multicollinearity and removed the highly correlated variables. the model was evaluated using silhouette coefficient and observed a efficiency score of 0.75. 

This project can also be extended to implement recommendation algorithms in any e-commerce websites or any ott platforms. word vectors are generated using the word2vec model from google. The word vectors are from the vocabulary in the word2vec model. 

Similarities are to be found using titles, genres and description. Used content-based recommendation systems to predict the movies similar to movies like breaking bad and 6 underground. The same movies used to test the k means clustering.
